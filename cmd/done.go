// doneCmd represents the done command

	Use:   "done [TODO number 1, TODO number 2]",
	Short: "Mark an existing TODO as completed",
	Long: `done command allows you to mark existing TODO(s) as completed; each TODO number is separated by a comma. For example:

	if you have a list of TODO like:
	1. wash dishes
	2. take bins out
	you could:
	$ task done 1, 2
	which will mark TODO 1 and 2 as complete and remove it from the list`,
	Args: cobra.MinimumNArgs(1),
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("Completed TODO:", strings.Join(args, ","))
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(doneCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// doneCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// doneCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
